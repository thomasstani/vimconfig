This is my Vim config. There are many like it but this one is mine.

This is how I push my config on a new machine where Git has already been installed:

// change to home directory
$ cd

//clone the github directory into the .vim file
$ git clone git@github.com:thomasstani:vimconfig.git .vim

//set vimrc to just find the vimrc within the vim files.
$ echo "runtime vimrc" > .vimrc

//in vim install the plugins
:PlugInstall
